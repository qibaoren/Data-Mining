1.take a quick look at the data structer 
 figure out the information of the dataset
 pay special attention to the missing values, data type, categorical attribute, summary of numerical attributes, visualization
 notice:
     1.whether the data has been scaled or capped at an interval
     2.look at the target attribute typically
     3.the shape of the data visualization
     
2.creat a test set,since your brain is highly prone to overfitting
a common solution to create a stable train/test split even after updating the dataset:
make sure every instance has a unique and immutable identifier 
compute a hash of each instance's identifier and put the instance in the test set if the hash is lower than or equal to 20% of the max hash value
notice:
  1.it is a random sampling method, but there is a risk of introducing a significant sampling bias
  2.there is an another method called stratified sampling.
   here ,you need to pay attention to some important attribute such as income, state......
  3.if you choose the method called stratified sampling,please make sure every stratum/strata is large enough

3.explore the data and gain more insights
 First, make sure you have put the test set aside and only explore the training set

4.looking for correlations and experimenting with arrtibute combinations
 just pearson's r,it only measures linear correlations and miss nonlinear relationships while it has nothing to do with the slope 
 create new attributer following your intuition

5.Data cleaning
  1.get rid of the corresponding districts
  2.get rid of the whole attribute
  3.set the values to some value(zero, the mean, the median, etc)

6.handing text amd categorical attributes
